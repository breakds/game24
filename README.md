A lazy-bone Tutorial.

### Introduction

lazy-bone is a Common Lisp web application framework, mainly based on [Parenscript](http://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/) and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/). This tutorial demonstrates building a web application that solves the 24 Game with lazy-bone. All the code (both server side and client side) resides in one single common lisp file, and you should expect an effortless trip reading this article. :P
